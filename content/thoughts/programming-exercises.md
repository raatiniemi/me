I've recently decided to try to learn myself a few new languages, concepts,
paradigms, etc. My reasoning behind this is as follows. The more paradigms,
concepts, etc. you're familiar with, the better solutions you'll be able to
produce.

And, since simple reasonable projects are usually rather hard to think of, I've
decided to start writing short simple projects, or solutions to common problems,
that's suitable to what I'm trying to learn.

Examples of this would be, [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)s
in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), sort or search algorithm in
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), error handling in [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/),
or working with a [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database),
such as [Neo4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j). And, the focus would be
on the concept or algorithm, the idiomatic way of working with the language, or
just to simply refine my knowledge of the domain at hand.

Also, introducing new a perspective or way of thinking, e.g.
[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) vs.
[object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),
is always good. And, it'll keep things fun and interesting.
