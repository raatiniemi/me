# Hi there! I'm Tobias.

I'm an enthusiastic software developer living in Sweden. I love building things
that brings value to people.

## At work...

I work at [Atea Sverige AB](https://www.atea.se/), where my primary focus is
building, improving, and maintaining Viva Omsorg. It's an application available
for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/viva-omsorg/id1041319999?mt=8)
and Android (currently in beta), which we've developed together with Cambio
(previously ILAB) for use in the home healthcare sector.

I'm also leading the work to improve and scale our continuous integration and
continuous deployment infrastructure, to accommodate our ever growing list of
projects.
