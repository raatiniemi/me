# Hi there! I'm Tobias.

I'm an enthusiastic software developer living in Sweden. I love building things with technology that brings value to people.

## From the beginning...

My programming journey began in the early 2000's, while still in high school, I taught myself basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and classic ASP (when that was still a thing, sort of).

After I finished my education in 2010, I got a job as a web developer for a marketing/communication agency, where we were primarily building websites for clients using PHP and WordPress. I was also responsible for ensuring that our internal server infrastructure was running smoothly, it was here that I found the joy of using Linux (which our server infrastructure was using).

From there, in late 2012, I joined a team building the business platform used by a large national retail chain in the home improvement sector. Here my focus was to build and maintain our iOS enterprise application (using Objective-C), build the infrastructure for our data ingestion pipelines, and help to build the web application as well as the APIs (using PHP, MySQL, and ExtJS). As we were a rather small team, we quickly found that in order to be able to maintain and improve the system over time the use of automated pipelines were required. This also reduced the risk with new releases and improved the autonomy of the development team.

## At work...

And now, since 2017, I work as a Principal Engineer at a consulting company, where my focus is divided between contributing to the development of one of our products in the healthcare sector, leading the improvement work for our internal platform infrastructure, and improve our internal workflows.

Within the product team, my role is to develop and maintain both the Android and iOS applications, as well as associated services, such as a real-time communication system. The mobile applications are written in Kotlin for Android and Swift/Objective-C for iOS. The associated services are built using a diverse technology stack, including Spring Boot with Kotlin, .NET with C#, and Rust. Additionally, I handle server maintenance as well as provide technical support.

Beyond my product work, I lead initiatives to improve and scale our internal DevSecOps platform. This work includes a wide range of tasks, from creating virtual machines, configuring networks, installing and patching applications to designing CI/CD pipeline templates. Our pipeline templates support multiple different languages and platforms, and cover the entire application lifecycle &mdash; from building and testing to security scanning and deploying to different cloud or on-premise environments.

Lastly, I mentor both our junior and senior developers, to help them with advancing their technical skills, solving complex challenges, and adopting best practices for building maintainable software.
